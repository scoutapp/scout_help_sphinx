# Integrations

## GitHub

Scout annotates several areas of the UI with additional data from the app's associated Git repository when the GitHub integration is enabled.

### Traces

When the GitHub integration is enabled, Scout displays the actual code from backtraces collected from [transaction traces](#transaction-traces). The code is annotated with the `git blame` data (the author and commit date), making it easier to track down developers most familar with bottlenecks.

### Deploys

When the GitHub integration is enabled, Scout annotates [deploys](#deploy-tracing) with the associated Git branch or tag along. When hovering over a deploy, a `diff` summary is displayed. This displays the changes between the selected deploy and the previous deploy.

The GitHub integration is an __app-specific__ integration, authenticated via OAuth. After authenticating, choose the Git repository name and branch name used for your application.

### Missing some repositories?

When configuring the GitHub integration, you may notice that only personal repositories are shown and repositories owned by organizations are missing. Your organization is likely leveraging trusted applications. See [GitHub's docs on organization-approved applications](https://github.com/blog/1941-organization-approved-applications) for instructions approving Scout. Once Scout is listed as an approved application, the org's repositories will be available within Scout.

## Rollbar

When the Rollbar integration is enabled, Scout displays errors from the app's associated Rollbar project alongside performance data within the Scout UI.

When the error count is in <span style="color:#fff;background:#f0592a;padding: 2px">orange</span>, a new error has appeared in the current timeframe. When the error count is in <span style="background:#ccc;padding:2px">gray</span>, older errors are continuing in this timeframe.

The Rollbar configuration is an __app-specific__ integration, configured by providing a read-only Rollbar __Project Access Token__ (not an Account Access Token) in the app settings within Scout.
